### Customizing this theme

This theme uses SCSS files which are compliled into a single CSS file. Future changes _must_ be made the source SCSS files to ensure a single source of truth.
Additional CSS may be added from the WordPress customizer. This doesn't modify the theme styles, but will be loaded additionally.

This theme uses [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) (AKA CSS Variables). This enables some of the theme's colors to be changed without having to modify the theme itself.

These colours can be changed by adding the following to the WordPress customizer Additional CSS section.

```css
/* Override the Joyce Wong Theme colours with these variables: */
:root {
  --custom-main-orange: red;
  --custom-main-orange-light: orange;
  --custom-white: yellow;
  --custom-body-dark: blue;
  --custom-title-dark: indigo;
  --custom-transparent-white: violet;
}
```
